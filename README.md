# 2. Usage

1. Right Click on "wTM-Removal.cmd" <br><img src="img/tutorial-1.png">
2. "Run as Administrator"
3. Accept the UAC Prompt for Powershell <br><img src="img/tutorial-2.png">
4. On Removal request answer with Y/y -> Enter <br><img src="img/tutorial-3.png"><br><img src="img/tutorial-4.png">
5. Reboot System, Rerun the Script once more.
6. On a third run the Script should display that there was nothing more found and exit after 10 Seconds.
7. Run Windows Troubleshooting for Windows Updates

The Malware maniupulates the Windows Update Service in some cases. This should prevent Windows Update to mess with the Malware and make it unusable.

## 2.1 Differentiation between OS Languages

To address the [Issue](https://github.com/pabumake/windowToolboxMalware-Removal/issues/8) I added a more clearer output on the Tool:
<img src="img/tutorial-5.png"><br>
<img src="img/tutorial-6.png">

The Message is now to be differentiated in red/green and for our colorblind folks in [ ! ] / [ - ].<br>
Also we added Yellow for small explaination and [ ? ] for colorblind folks.

## 3.2 Are you affected ?
To check if you are infected: <br>
Open PowerShell as Administrator
```
Get-WinSystemLocale
```

if "Name" start with "en-" <br>
Check for the rest, if not, then you are most likely safe. <br>

Do these folders exist?
```
C:\systemfile\
C:\Windows\security\pywinvera
C:\Windows\security\pywinveraa
```

Do these Tasks exist in Task Scheduler
```
Microsoft\Windows\AppID\VerifiedCert
Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Maintenance
Microsoft\Windows\Services\CertPathCheck
Microsoft\Windows\Services\CertPathw
Microsoft\Windows\Servicing\ComponentCleanup
Microsoft\Windows\Servicing\ServiceCleanup
Microsoft\Windows\Shell\ObjectTask
Microsoft\Windows\Clip\ServiceCleanup
```

Then you are affected!

## 3.3 Why are only "en-" Users affected ?
There is a check in Stage 3, where the bad stuff happens, here it checks for the SystemLocale if it is not "en-" it kills the cmd.exe, <br>
Which stops everything else (look at the first showcase linked above). <br>
On the right side you see the Processes, here if it reaches 560 cmd.exe it opens PowerShell with the check. <br>

The check fails (for us Germans, for example) and it kills itself. <br>
For others, the script just keeps going. <br>
